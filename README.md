# Apple Music Barcodes/ISRCs

Allows reading barcodes, ISRCs, and other metadata from Apple Music releases. Click the green sqaure in the upper-left corner of the page to display album metadata.

Note that the tool does not work if you navigate around in Apple Music. Refresh the page once you get to the album you want for it to work.

Tested with Violentmonkey in Firefox but should also work in Chrome.

## Installing

Install [the script](https://github.com/ToadKing/apple-music-barcode-isrc/raw/master/apple-music-barcode-isrc.user.js) using your prefered userscript manager.
